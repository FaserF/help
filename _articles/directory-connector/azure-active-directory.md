This article will help you get started using Directory Connector to sync users and groups from your Azure Active Directory to your Bitwarden Organization.

## Azure AD Setup

Complete the following processes from the Microsoft Azure Portal before configuring Directory Connector. Directory Connector will require information obtained from these processes to function properly.

### Create App Registration

Complete the following steps to create an app registration for Directory Connector:

1. From your Microsoft Azure portal, navigate to the **Azure Active Directory** resource.
2. From the left-hand navigation, select **App registrations**.
3. Select the **New registration** button and give your registration a Bitwarden-specific name (e.g. `bitwarden-dc`).
4. Select **Register**.

### Grant App Permissions

Complete the following steps to grant the created app registration the required permissions:

1. On the created Bitwarden application, select **API Permissions** from the left-hand navigation.
2. Select the **Add a permission** button.
3. When prompted to Select an API, select **Microsoft Graph**.
4. Set the following **Delegated permissions**:
   - User > User.ReadBasic.All (Read all users' basic profiles)
   - User > User.Read.All (Read all users' full profiles)
   - Group > Group.Read.All (Read all groups)
   - AdministrativeUnit > AdministrativeUnit.Read.All (Only required if you'll be syncing [Administrative Units](#specify-sync-filters))
5. Set the following **Application Permissions**:
   - User > User.Read.All (Read all users' full profiles)
   - Group > Group.Read.All (Read all groups)
   - AdministrativeUnit > Administrative.Unit.Read.All (Only required if you'll be syncing [Administrative Units](#specify-sync-filters))
6. Back on the API Permissions page, select the **Grant admin consent for...** button.

### Create App Secret Key

Complete the following steps to create a secret key to be used by Directory Connector:

1. On the created Bitwarden application, select **Certificates & secrets** from the left-hand navigation.
2. Select the **New client secret** button and add a Bitwarden-specific description (e.g. `bitwarden-dc-secret`) and an expiration date. We recommend selecting **Never**.
3. Select **Save** once you're finished.
4. Copy the secret's **value** to a safe place for later use.

### Get App ID

Complete the following steps to obtain the app ID to be used by Directory Connector:

1. On the created Bitwarden application, select **Overview** from the left-hand navigation.
2. Copy the **Application (client) ID** to a safe place for later use.

### Get Tenant Hostname

Complete the following steps to obtain the tenant hostname to be used by Directory Connector:

1. From anywhere in the Azure portal, select the **Directory + subscription** filter button from the main navigation.
2. Copy the **Current directory:** value to a safe place for later use.

## Connect to your Directory

Complete the following steps to configure Directory Connector to use your Azure Active Directory. If you haven't already, take the proper [Azure AD Setup](#azure-ad-setup) steps before proceeding:

1. Open the Directory Connector [Desktop Application]({{site.baseurl}}/article/directory-sync-desktop/).
2. Navigate to the **Settings** tab.
3. From the **Type** dropdown, select **Azure Active Directory**.

   The available fields in this section will change according to your selected Type.
4. Enter the collected [**Tenant** hostname](#get-tenant-hostname), [**Application Id**](#get-app-id), and [**Secret Key**](#create-app-secret-key).

## Configure Sync Options

{% callout success %}
When you're finished configuring, navigate to the **More** tab and select the **Clear Sync Cache** button to prevent potential conflicts with prior sync operations. For more information, see [Clear Sync Cache]({{site.baseurl}}/article/clear-sync-cache/).
{% endcallout %}

Complete the following steps to configure the settings used when syncing using Directory Connector:

1. Open the Directory Connector [Desktop Application]({{site.baseurl}}/article/directory-sync-desktop/).
2. Navigate to the **Settings** tab.
3. In the **Sync** section, configure the following options as desired:

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Interval|Time between automatic sync checks (in minutes).|
|Remove disabled users during sync|Check this box to remove users from the Bitwarden Organization that have been disabled in your directory.|
|Overwrite existing organization users based on current sync settings|Check this box to always perform a full sync and remove any users from the Bitwarden Organization if they are not in the synced user set.|
|More than 2000 users or groups are expected to sync.|Check this box if you expect to sync 2000+ users or groups. If you don't check this box, Directory Connector will limit a sync at 2000 users or groups.|
|Sync users|Check this box to sync users to your Organization.<br><br>Checking this box will allow you to specify **User Filters**.|
|User Filter|See [Specify Sync Filters](#specify-sync-filters).|
|Sync Groups|Check this box to sync groups to your Organization. Checking this box will allow you to specify **Group Filters**.|
|Group Filter|See [Specify Sync Filters](#specify-sync-filters).|

### Specify Sync Filters

Use comma-separated lists to include or exclude from a sync based on User Email, Group Name, or Group Membership:

#### User Filters

The following filtering syntaxes should be used in the **User Filter** field:

##### Include/Exclude Users by Email

To include or exclude specific users from a sync based on email address:
```
include:joe@example.com,bill@example.com,tom@example.com
```
```
exclude:jow@example.com,bill@example.com,tom@example.com
```

##### User by Group Membership

You can include or exclude users from a sync based on their Azure Active Directory group membership using the `includeGroup` and `excludeGroup` keywords. `includeGroup` and `excludeGroup` use Group Object ID, available from the **Overview** page of the group in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com){:target="\_blank"} or through the [Azure AD Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azuread/get-azureadgroup?view=azureadps-2.0){:target="\_blank"}:
```
includeGroup:963b5acd-9540-446c-8e99-29d68fcba8eb,9d05a51c-f173-4087-9741-a7543b0fd3bc
```
```
excludeGroup:963b5acd-9540-446c-8e99-29d68fcba8eb,9d05a51c-f173-4087-9741-a7543b0fd3bc
```

#### Group Filters

The following filtering syntaxes should be used in the **Group Filter** field:

##### Include/Exclude Groups

To include or exclude groups from a sync based on group name:
```
include:Group A,Group B
```
```
exclude:Group A,Group B
```

##### Group by Administrative Unit (AU)

You can include or exclude groups from a sync based on their tagged [Azure Active Directory Administrative Units (AUs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/administrative-units){:target="\_blank"} by using the `includeadministrativeunit` and `excludeadministrativeunit` keywords. `includeadministrativeunit` and `excludeadministrativeunit` use the **Object ID** of the Administrative Unit:
```
includeadministrativeunit:7ckcq6e5-d733-4b96-be17-5bad81fe679d
```
```
excludeadministrativeunit:7ckcq6e5-d733-4b96-be17-5bad81fe679d
```

## Test a Sync

To test whether Directory Connector will successfully connect to your directory and return the desired users and groups, navigate to the **Dashboard** tab and select the **Test Now** button. If successful, users and groups will be printed to the Directory Connector window according to specified [Sync Options](#configure-sync-options) and [Filters](#specify-sync-filters).

It may take up to 15 minutes for permissions for your application to properly propagate. In the meantime, you may receive `Insufficient privileges to complete the operation` errors.

{% callout info %}
If you get the error message `Resource <user id> does not exist or one of its queried reference-property objects are not present`, you'll need to permanently delete or restore the user(s) with `<user id>`. **Please note**, this was fixed in a recent version of Directory Connector. Update your application if you're still experiencing this error.
{% endcallout %}

## Start Automatic Sync

Once [Sync Options](#configure-sync-options) and [Filters](#specify-sync-filters) are configured and tested, you can begin syncing. Complete the following steps to start automatic syncing with Directory Connector:

1. Open the Directory Connector [Desktop Application]({{site.baseurl}}/article/directory-sync-desktop/).
2. Navigate to the **Dashboard** tab.
3. In the **Sync** section, select the **Start Sync** button.

   You may alternatively select the **Sync Now** button to execute a one-time manual sync.

Directory Connector will begin polling your directory based on the configured [Sync Options](#configure-sync-options) and [Filters](#specify-sync-filters).

If you exit or close the application, automatic sync will stop. To keep Directory Connector running in the background, minimize the application or hide it to the system tray.

## CLI data.json Parameter

The following parameters need to be changed from the [data.json](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/directory-sync-shared/){:target="\_blank"} template to integrate the Azure AD Connector:

apikey_clientId
entityId
entityType
apikey_clientSecret
organizationId
directoryType
directoryConfig_1
   key
   tenant
   applicationId
syncConfig
   users
   groups
   interval
   removeDisabled
   overwriteExisting
   largeImport
   userFilter
   groupFilter

Other options can be changed, but not all of them are necessary for an Azure AD Sync.

"directoryType": 1
stands for Azure Active Directory. This means that only the directoryConfig_1 is loaded.
